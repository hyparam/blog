# Hello World

> “Model behavior is not determined by architecture, hyperparameters, or optimizer choices. It’s determined by your dataset, nothing else. When you refer to “Lambda”, “ChatGPT”, “Bard”, or “Claude”, it’s not the model weights that you are referring to. It’s the dataset.” jbetker @ openai

Machine learning models are only as good as the data they're trained on. Our mission is simple: create the best training sets to build the world's best models.
